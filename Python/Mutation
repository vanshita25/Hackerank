We have seen that lists are mutable (they can be changed), and tuples are immutable (they cannot be changed).
Let's try to understand this with an example.
You are given an immutable string, and you want to make changes to it.
EXAMPLE
string = "abracadabra"

You can access the index by
print string[5]
a

What if you would like to assign a value?
>>> string[5] = 'k' 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment

How would you approach this?
1) One solution is to convert the string to a list and then change the value.
>>> string = "abracadabra"
>>> l = list(string)
>>> l[5] = 'k'
>>> string = ''.join(l)
>>> print string
abrackdabra

2)Another approach is to slice the string and join it back.
>>> string = string[:5] + "k" + string[6:]
>>> print string
abrackdabra

Task
Read a given string, change the character at a given index and then print the modified string.

Sample Input
abracadabra
5 k

Sample Output
abrackdabra

Solution
def mutate_string(string, position, character):
    l=list(string)
    l[int(i)]=c  
    string=''.join(l) 
    return string

if __name__ == '__main__':
    s = raw_input()
    i, c = raw_input().split()
    s_new = mutate_string(s, int(i), c)
    print s_new
